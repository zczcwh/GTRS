# A Lightweight Graph Transformer Network for Human Mesh Reconstruction from 2D Human Pose
The project is an official implementation of our paper [A Lightweight Graph Transformer Network for Human Mesh Reconstruction from 2D Human Pose](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12696).

## Installation
Check [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.

## Quick demo
We provide demo codes to run end-to-end inference on the test images. Please check [DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md) for details.

## Datasets Download
Please download the required datasets following [DOWNLOAD.md](docs/DOWNLOAD.md). 

## Experiment

The `experiment` directory should contain following folders. 
```
${ROOT}  
|-- experiment  
|   |-- pam_h36m
|   |   |-- best.pth.tar
|   |-- gtrs_h36m
|   |   |-- final.pth.tar
|   |-- pam_3dpw
|   |   |-- best.pth.tar
|   |-- pam_3dpw
|   |   |-- final.pth.tar
```

### Pretrained model weights
The pretrained model weights can be download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fIzs5zaEcqzjOmggYXlD8lcO4JAJPb4o/view?usp=sharing) to a corresponding directory.

### Testing

You can choose the config file in `${ROOT}/asset/yaml/` to evaluate the corresponding experiment by running: 

```
python main/test.py --gpu 0,1, --cfg ./asset/yaml/gtrs_{input joint set}_test_{dataset name}.yml
```

For example, if you want to test the results on Human3.6M dataset, you can run:

```
python main/test.py --gpu 0,1, --cfg ./asset/yaml/gtrs_human36J_test_human36.yml
```

### Training
We provide the pretrain models of PAM module. To train GTRS, you can run: 

```
python main/train.py --gpu 0,1, --cfg ./asset/yaml/gtrs_{input joint set}_train_{dataset name}.yml
```

For example, if you want to train on Human3.6M dataset, you can run:

```
python main/train.py --gpu 0,1, --cfg ./asset/yaml/gtrs_human36J_train_human36.yml
```

Also if you prefer training from the scratch, you should pre-train PAM module first by running:

```
python main/train.py --gpu 0,1, --cfg ./asset/yaml/pam_{input joint set}_train_{dataset name}.yml
```
